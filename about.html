<p>The Basic Gospel is a ministry dedicated to the practical teaching of the Christian life from the Scriptures. Posts are geared to new and young believers seeking to grow in their faith in Christ.</p>

<p>My name is Gabriel Guerrero and I have been a Christian since 2003. Since then, I have learned a lot in my growth as a Christian and have always had a passion to teach. I started this website as a companion to the New Testament Outreach Bibles that I hand out. I want basic bible teaching on the New Testament to be available for free to everyone.</p>

<p>The Bible is a deep book, but I believe anyone who gives their life to Jesus Christ can grown in wisdom, knowledge, and understanding with daily reading, prayer, and a little guidance. I appreciate you stopping by and hope the content was a blessing to you.</p></p>
